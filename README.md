# Ash3d_cryptotephra
This software sets up and runs a large number of simulations using the tephra dispersal software Ash3d.  It was written to track the dispersal of distal volcanic ash throughout the northern hemisphere for comparison with cryptotephra deposits, particularly in Greenland.  

This software requires **[Ash3d](https://github.com/hshwaiger-usgs/Ash3d)**, **[Generic Mapping Tools (GMT)](https://www.generic-mapping-tools.org/)**, **[ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php)**, a Fortran compiler such as **[GNU gfortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/)** and a python interpreter.  It is intended for use on a linux system.  Full instructions on how to download and use this software is in the readme.txt file in the src directory.
