# Explanation of contents

This example output directory contains a subset of results generated using this script on October 12, 2023, using simulations of an eruption from Katmai volcano, Alaska.  The directory contents are as follows:

DepositFiles/ESRI-ASCII
    Contains gridded ascii files of deposit mass load in kg/m2, in ESRI-ASCII format
    which can be imported into ESRI GIS software.  Files in directory are named "Run00001.txt",
    Run0002.txt" etc.
DepositFiles/Matlab
    Contains gridd ascii deposit files of mass load, in a format that can be loaded into
    Matlab using Matlab's "load" command.  Files in directory are named "Run00001.txt",
    Run0002.txt" etc.
InputFiles
    Input files for each run.  File format is explained in the Ash3d documentation.  Files are
    named "Run00001.txt", "Run00002.txt etc.
MapFiles
    Deposit maps of mass load (g/m2) from each run, in gif format.  Files are named "Run00001.gif",
    "Run00002.gif" etc.
Sample_massload
    ASCII files listing sample mass load from each run at several ice core locations.  Files are 
    named "Run00001.txt", "Run00002.txt" etc.
summary
    Summary tables of model inputs "input_summary.txt" and deposit mass load 
    (misnamed "thickness_summary.txt") at ice core locations for each run.
zip_files
    Zip files from each run, containing all model input and output.  This file also includes
    a netcdf file of output ("3d_tephra_fall.nc"), the Ash3d system output generated during the
    run ("Ash3d_logfile.txt"), and a logfile generated by redirecting standard output from
    the screen ("logfile.txt").
